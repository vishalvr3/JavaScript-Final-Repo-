/*
******************  Statements and Expressions ***************
👉🏽 Expressions:
              It is a piece of code that produces a value
              e.g; 
                    3 + 4 is an expression
                    1971 is an expression
                    true && false && !false is an expression

👉🏽 Statements:
              It is a bigger piece of code that is executed and which does not produce a value on itself and we can compare this with normal spoken language....
              like, a declaration is like a complete sentence and expression are like words that make up the sentences.
